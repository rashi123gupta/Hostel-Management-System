## PROJECT TITLE:
Hostel Management System


## DESCRIPTION:
This project aims to develop a Hostel Management System using Serverless Architecture. Built with 'React.js' and 'Firebase', the system provides a modern, cloud-native solution for streamlining hostel operations. 
Serverless architecture (also known as serverless computing) is a software design pattern where applications are hosted by a third-party service, eliminating the need for server software and hardware management by the developer. Applications are broken up into individual functions that can be invoked and scaled individually.

It allows students to:
- view and edit his/her profile;
- request leaves;
- raise complaints.

The admin can:
- view and edit his/her profile;
- view all the users;
- edit type (admin/student) of the users;
- approve/reject student's leave request;
- resolve student's complaints.


## KEY FEATURES:
- User-friendly Interface
- Role-based Access
- Real-time Dashboard for Admin & Student
- Leave Management
- Complaint Handling
- Scalability


## QUALITY ATTRIBUTE:
SCALABILITY - Scalability refers to the system's ability to handle an increasing amount of work or to be easily enlarged to accomodate growth in user base and data volume.
Our choice of Firebase as a backend is key to the system's scalability. Services like Firestore and Firebase Authentication are designed to handle growth in users and data automatically, allowing the application to maintain performance without manual intervention.


## TECHNOLOGY USED:
- Frontend: React.js
- Backend & Database: Firebase (Authentication, Firestore)
- Hosting: Firebase Hosting
- Styling: CSS


## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy up and running.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine
- `npm` or `yarn` package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   git clone https://github.com//rashi123gupta/Hostel-Management-System
 
2. Install NPM packages
   npm install

3. Verify Firebase Configuration: The necessary Firebase configuration is already included in this project. You do not need to create 
your own account or set up any API keys.

4. Start the development server
   npm start


## DEMONSTRATION CREDENTIALS:
For demonstration and testing purposes, you can use the following pre-configured accounts. These accounts have been created in the Firebase Authentication system to allow for immediate access to both user roles.

- Student Account:
    Email               Password
student1@gmail.com      student1

- Admin Account:
    Email               Password
admin11@gmail.com       admin1
